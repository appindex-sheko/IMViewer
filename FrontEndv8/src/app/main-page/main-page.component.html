        The Discovery common information model consists of an integrated set of components that support machine processable and human readable information about data in the Discovery Data Service.

        The model has a much broader definition than simply a data model. It involves the modelling of the meaning off data and the way in which data is converted to information.

        More specifically, in this context, the information model is tailored to illustrate arrangements of health and care data as held in health records for the purposes of understanding and query as described by the objectives of the <a
